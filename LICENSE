Summary (Not Legal Terms)
-------------------------

1. Definitions
--------------
"Software" means the code, binaries, designs, documentation, and other materials provided under this license, including any modifications you make.
"Personal Use" means use by a natural person solely for personal learning, experimentation, or hobby projects where no entity (employer, client, company, nonprofit, or government) benefits and no revenue is generated.
"Gross Receipts" include all consideration—cash or in-kind—from sales, licenses, subscriptions (monthly, annual, per-seat, usage-based), service retainers, bundles, sponsorships, or any monetized deployment that incorporates the Software.
"Organizational Use" includes any use by or for a business, client, employer, contractor, nonprofit, school, or government entity regardless of profit status.

2. Personal License Grant
-------------------------
Subject to this agreement, BatesAI grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to run, modify, and share the Software for Personal Use at no cost.

3. Attribution Requirement
-------------------------
All distributions, showcases, user interfaces, documentation, marketing materials, and app store listings that include the Software must display: "Built with BatesAI software by Daniel Bates (https://batesai.org)."
You may adjust formatting but the words "BatesAI" and the URL must remain legible wherever credits normally appear.

4. Sharing for Personal Use
---------------------------
You may share unmodified or modified versions for Personal Use only if you:
(a) include this complete license, and
(b) preserve the attribution described above.

5. Organizational & Commercial Use
----------------------------------
Any Organizational Use requires **one** of the following prior to launch, sale, or external deployment:
(a) a written commercial license from BatesAI, or
(b) payment of a revenue share equal to ten percent (10%) of Gross Receipts attributable to the Software, including but not limited to subscriptions, recurring maintenance fees, pay-per-use charges, licensing royalties, and bundled product revenue.

6. Reporting & Payment Mechanics
--------------------------------
If you choose revenue sharing, you must:
- Email monthly revenue summaries to daniel@batesai.org within fifteen (15) days after each month ends, and
- Remit the 10% payment within the same fifteen-day window via a method specified by BatesAI.
Late or missing reports or payments immediately suspend this license for Organizational Use until cured.

7. No Sublicensing or White Labeling
------------------------------------
You may not sublicense, relicense, white-label, or represent the Software as exclusively your own. Clients and end users must receive this license and the attribution notice.

8. Term & Termination
---------------------
This license remains in effect until terminated. BatesAI may terminate immediately if you breach any term. You have fourteen (14) days after written notice to cure a breach, except that unauthorized commercial deployment or failure to pay revenue share results in immediate termination. Upon termination you must cease distribution and use unless a new written agreement is executed.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty & Liability
-------------------------------------
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BATESAI IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM USE OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR DATA LOSS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
